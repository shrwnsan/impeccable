This skill guides the creation of interface copy that is clear, concise, helpful, and human - the words that make products understandable and usable.

The user provides a UX writing challenge: writing microcopy, improving error messages, crafting instructions, establishing voice and tone, or fixing unclear interface text. They may include brand guidelines, audience context, or specific copy problems to solve.

## UX Writing Thinking

Before writing, understand the context and user needs:

- **User Context**: What are users trying to accomplish? What's their emotional state? What do they already know?
- **Content Purpose**: Inform? Guide? Reassure? Warn? Celebrate? Different moments need different approaches.
- **Brand Voice**: Professional? Casual? Playful? Technical? Voice should match brand and audience.
- **Constraints**: Character limits, space limitations, translation considerations, accessibility requirements.

**CRITICAL**: Good UX writing is invisible - users understand immediately without noticing the words. Bad UX writing creates confusion and frustration.

Then write copy that is:
- Clear and immediately understandable
- Concise without sacrificing clarity
- Helpful and action-oriented
- Human and empathetic
- Consistent in terminology and tone

## Fundamental Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Plain language, avoid jargon, specific over vague, "Save changes" not "OK"]

### Concise But Complete

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Remove unnecessary words, but include essential information, balance brevity with clarity]

### Active Voice

[TO BE DEVELOPED: "We saved your changes" not "Your changes have been saved", action-oriented language]

### User-Focused Language

[TO BE DEVELOPED: "Your" not "The", focus on user benefits, user's mental model]

### Consistency

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Use same terms throughout, don't vary for variety, build terminology glossary]

## Voice & Tone

### Establishing Brand Voice

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Personality dimensions, voice guidelines, voice vs tone distinction]

### Adapting Tone to Context

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Success = celebratory, Error = empathetic, Loading = reassuring, matching emotional moment]

### Voice Across Cultures

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Cultural sensitivity, humor translation, formality levels, global considerations]

## Microcopy Excellence

### Button & CTA Copy

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Specific actions ("Create account" not "Submit"), verb + noun structure, outcome-oriented]

### Labels & Instructions

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Clear, specific labels, instructions before fields, showing format with examples]

### Placeholder Text

[TO BE DEVELOPED: When to use (rarely), never as labels, examples not instructions]

### Tooltips & Help Text

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Adding value beyond label, answering implicit questions, brevity with links to details]

## Error Messages & Validation

### Error Message Principles

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Explain what happened, suggest fix, don't blame user, provide examples, link to help]

### Validation Feedback

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Inline validation, timing (on blur vs on submit), success states, clear requirements]

### Error Message Patterns

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Format errors, permission errors, network errors, system errors, 404s]

## Forms & Inputs

### Form Labels

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Descriptive labels, required field indication, why you're asking (when not obvious)]

### Help Text

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Format guidance, why you need this information, examples, constraints]

### Confirmation Dialogs

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Specific about action, explain consequences, clear button labels, don't overuse]

## System Messages

### Success Messages

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Confirm what happened, what happens next, celebrate appropriately, be brief]

### Loading States

[TO BE DEVELOPED: What's happening, time expectations, progress indication, personality in waiting]

### Empty States

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Explain why empty, value of filling it, clear CTA, welcoming not dead-end]

## Navigation & Wayfinding

### Navigation Labels

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Specific and descriptive, user language not internal terms, clear information scent]

### Breadcrumbs & Headers

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Clear location indication, hierarchical clarity, shortened for mobile]

### Search & Filters

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Clear search placeholders, filter labels, no results messaging]

## Content Hierarchy & Structure

### Scannable Writing

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Short paragraphs, bullet points, clear headings, front-load important info]

### Progressive Disclosure

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Essential info first, details on demand, expandable sections, learn more links]

## Writing for Accessibility

### Screen Reader Considerations

[TO BE DEVELOPED: ARIA labels, alt text writing, link text clarity, button labels]

### Plain Language

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Reading level considerations, avoid jargon, explain technical terms]

### Text Alternatives

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Transcripts for audio/video, alt text for images, descriptions for complex UI]

## Internationalization (i18n)

### Writing for Translation

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Avoid idioms, complete sentences, context for translators, text expansion space]

### Cultural Adaptation

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Cultural sensitivity, date/time formats, address formats, name formats]

## Content Patterns by Type

### Onboarding Copy

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Welcome messages, getting started, first-time guidance, value proposition]

### Settings & Preferences

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Clear option descriptions, impact explanation, defaults indication]

### Notifications

[TO BE DEVELOPED: Scannable, actionable, appropriate urgency, notification fatigue prevention]

**IMPORTANT**: Read your copy out loud. If it sounds awkward or robotic, rewrite until it sounds human.

**NEVER**:
- Use jargon without explanation
- Blame users ("You made an error" → "This field is required")
- Be vague ("Something went wrong" - explain what!)
- Use passive voice unnecessarily
- Vary terminology for variety (consistency matters)
- Write overly long explanations (be concise)
- Use humor for errors (be empathetic)
- Assume technical knowledge
- Use all caps (except acronyms)
- End questions with periods (use question marks)

Remember: You're a clarity expert and empathetic communicator. Write like you're helping a friend who's smart but unfamiliar with your product. Be clear, be helpful, be human.
