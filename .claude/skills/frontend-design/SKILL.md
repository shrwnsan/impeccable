This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.



## Design Patterns Reference

This reference defines what TO do and what NOT to do when creating frontend interfaces. These patterns fight against model bias—the tendency of LLMs to converge on the same predictable choices.

### What TO Do (Patterns)

Focus on intentional, distinctive design choices:

**Typography**: Use a modular type scale with a distinctive display font paired with a refined body font. Establish clear hierarchy through weight, size, and spacing—not size alone.

**Color**: Build palettes from a dominant color with sharp accents. Use off-whites and near-blacks for sophistication. Always meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.

**Space**: Use a spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96). Create visual rhythm through varied spacing. Let content breathe. Break the grid intentionally.

**Motion**: Animate with purpose—guide attention and confirm actions. Use 150-300ms for micro-interactions. Prefer transform and opacity with smooth ease-out curves (quart, quint, expo). Stagger reveals for orchestrated page loads.

**Interaction**: Design clear focus indicators. Make touch targets 44×44px minimum. Provide immediate feedback. Write specific, helpful error messages.

**Responsive**: Design mobile-first. Use fluid typography with clamp(). Ensure all functionality works across devices.

### What NOT to Do (Anti-Patterns)

These patterns create generic "AI slop" aesthetics:

**Generic Visuals**: Defaulting to Inter/Roboto/Arial, purple-to-blue gradients on white, pure grays without color tint, wrapping everything in rounded cards, decorative shadows without purpose.

**Structural Issues**: Arbitrary spacing without a scale, hierarchy through size alone, equal spacing everywhere, cards nested inside cards, redundant copy (headers restating intros, repeated explanations).

**Motion Mistakes**: Bounce and elastic easing (dated and tacky), animating layout properties, durations over 500ms for feedback, animation without purpose.

**Interaction Failures**: Removing focus outlines without alternatives, placeholder text as labels, touch targets under 44×44px, generic "Something went wrong" errors, gray text on colored backgrounds.

**Accessibility Violations**: Color-only meaning, ignoring prefers-reduced-motion, failing WCAG contrast, creating keyboard traps.

These anti-patterns are baked into training data from countless generic templates. Without explicit guidance, AI reproduces them. This skill ensures your AI knows both what to do AND what to avoid.

## When to Use Reference Files

- **Quick builds**: Use this main skill file for most frontend work
- **Deep dives**: Consult specific reference files when facing complex challenges in that domain
- **Systematic work**: When building design systems or establishing patterns, reference multiple domain files
- **Troubleshooting**: When something feels "off", check the relevant domain reference for best practices
